1. sw sw sw add add add
2. lw lw lw add add add

TODO-

GENERATION DONE-

TESTING DONE-

stress tests using 1023 instructions - done but with 400 instructions, and memory set to all 0s (as offset issues are cropping up)
using value just saved into memory again (using sw)
using value just lw'ed
test cases we used
multiple permutations of {lw*3, add*3, sw*3}
add into the same register
sll and srl something negative (the source register value, not the shift)
accessing something with negative register values
access instruction memory

FURTHER NOTES-

sw and lw many times


remember to submit the simulation as well - save the waveform
