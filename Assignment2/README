Program implemented: Tic Tac Toe game

Implementation details:

We have an infinite loop as the major part of the main body of a program which acts as the loop which works as the interactive part of the game.

This loop first prints the player whose turn this is, and prompts the player to first give the row and column number in 0-indexing. Then it checks if the input is valid or not, and that works by checking if the row and column numbers we got are between 0 and 2 (both inclusive) or not, and if the square at that location is empty or not. In the case that the input is invalid, we ask the player to give a correct input till the player doesn't give a valid input.
Then we change the player number, and mark the value of the player's placeholder on the board (it is 1 for the first player, 10 for the second player and 0 for no move). Now we check if there has been a 3-in-a-row/column/diagonal situation (by adding up numbers in a row/column/diagonal, and checking if any of them is 3 or 30). If someone has won, we jump to a label that indicates that by a message, and prints the final board and returns. 
Then we check for a tie, which is checked in the end of the game, and that is done by checking if the sum of numbers on the board is 45 or not. If a tie has been reached, we jump to a label which indicates that and prints the final board and returns.
Now in the case that none of the situations above have happened, we print the board, and then jump back to the loop.
